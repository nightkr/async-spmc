#+TITLE: SPMC (single-producer, multi-consumer) channels

This is an implementation of SPMC channels by effectively inverting a MPSC (multi-producer, single-consumer) channel. Each ready consumer sends a oneshot channel
into the MPSC channel. The producer tries to grab any available oneshot channel and fulfils it.

* (Not-so) FAQ

** Is it fast?

No. It's around 5x slower than the underlying MPSC channel under the best of circumstances.

** Is it stable?

No, it seems to explode and deadlock somewhere between 20 and 30 consumers.

** Is it reliable?

No, a receiver will drop any pending message when dropped.

** Can it summon nostril demons?

Not by itself. ~futures::channel~ might though, who knows?

** Does it depend on Tokio?

No.

** Is it on crates.io?

No.

** Why?

Sometimes experiments have to be carried out, however ill-advised.

** Is it Cyber Resilience Act-compliant?

Probably not.
